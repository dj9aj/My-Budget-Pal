My Budget Pal

My Budget Pal is a RESTful full-stack application that I have built with Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js and MongoDB. It allows a user to create an account, and log income/expense receipts. Receipts can be edited or deleted. The user can categorize receipts and monitor the current budget available. The app is styled with pure CSS and Flexbox.

My app is deployed and available to use -
